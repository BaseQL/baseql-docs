# Querying

### Data Types
<SupportedBy gsheets={false}/>

<Callout type="info" emoji={(<img width="16" src="/gsheets-icon-64.png" style={{display: 'inline'}} title="google sheets"/>)}>
  Google Spreadsheets will always return data as `String` values
</Callout>

BaseQL supports querying most Airtable data types, checkout our [`StangerThings` kitchensink base](https://airtable.com/shrjevFPtREOPPxWj):

<br />

<QueryPlayground query={`{
  strangerThings {
    checkBox
    rating
    multiSelect
    email
    currency
    attachments
  }\n}`}/>

### Relationships & Nested values
<SupportedBy gsheets={false}/>

You can query nested values at an arbitrialy deep level:

<br />

<QueryPlayground query={`{
  people(name: "ben") {
    name
    friends {
      name
      friends {
        name
      }
    }
  }\n}`}/>

### Sanitization
<SupportedBy />

BaseQL will automatically sanitize table and column names to comply with the [GraphQL Specification](http://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Names), by:
- [Deburring](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#deburr) & removing special and Non-ASCII characters.
- Trim spaces by [camelCase](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.15#camelCase)â€™ing 
- Prepending an underscore when it starts with a number

In addition, BaseQL will sanitize field names which collide with reserved fields. Currently the only reserved field is the `id` field.

Examples:

- `   dÃ©jÃ  vu%  ` -> `dejaVu`
- `99Ballons` -> `_99Ballons`
- `ID` -> `_id`

### Misc GraphQL
<SupportedBy />

BaseQL currently supports other standard GraphQL features such as [Aliases](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#aliases),  [Fragments](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#fragments), [Operation Names](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#operation-name) and [Variables](https://graphql.org/learn/queries/#variables):

<QueryPlayground fullWidth={true}
  query={`query Veganism($country: [String] = ["ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸USA"]) {
  vegan: people(vegan: true, country: $country) { ...peopleFields },
  nonVegan: people(vegan: false, country: $country) { ...peopleFields }\n}\n\nfragment peopleFields on people {
  name
  vegan
  country
  friends {
    name
    vegan
    country
  }\n}`}/>
