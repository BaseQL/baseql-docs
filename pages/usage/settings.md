## Secret Token

In order to protect your endpoints you can enable auth using a Token which is secret and unique per account.

Use it along the `Authorization` HTTP header as a `Bearer` token.

Checkout specific examples for [cURL](/examples/curl) and  [Javascript](/examples/javascript).

## Mutations

You can enable Mutations, which are disabled by default for security purposes.

It's recommended to enable secret token protection when using mutations

[See Mutations docs](/usage/mutations)
