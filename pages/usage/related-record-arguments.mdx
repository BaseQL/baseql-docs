# Filtering & Sorting Related Records
<SupportedBy airtable={true} gsheets={false}/>

BaseQL supports filtering, pagination, and sorting arguments on nested relation fields, giving you precise control over how related data is fetched.

## Example Query

<QueryPlayground query={`{
  people(name: "Rob") {
    name
    friends(
      _filter: { vegan: true }
      _order_by: { name: "asc" }
      _page_size: 2
      _page: 1
    ) {
      name
      vegan
      city {
        name
      }
    }
  }
}`}/>

This query:
1. Finds people named "Rob"
2. Gets their friends who are vegan
3. Orders those friends by name in ascending order
4. Returns the first 2 friends from page 1

## Available Arguments

All nested relation fields support these arguments:

| Argument | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `_filter` | Filter related records using the same syntax as root-level filters |
| `_order_by` | Sort related records by one or more fields |
| `_page_size` | Number of related records to return per page |
| `_page` | Which page of related records to return |
